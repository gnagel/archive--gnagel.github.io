      I recently created this blog on GitHub.com for free.  This page is powered by Jekyll, an amazing website generator designed for minimal/static pages hosted on GitHub.

      The simplicity of Jekyllâ€™s rendering, theming, and writing workflow is excellent; however, setting up my first page took a longer than I expected.

        Why choose Github-pages vs Wordpress or Squarespace?
    </h4>

    <p class="caption">
      I recently became interested in github-pages after seeing numerious project pages hosted on github using the jekyll framework.  I found other hosting solutions, such as Wordpress and Squarespace, too heavy-weight.
      <br>*The WYSIWYG editors made it hard see what the generated HTML would be.
      <br>*The CSS &amp; JS bloated out to of controll.
      <br>*Backing up a Wordpress site is a huge pain.
      <br>*As a developer I wanted access to the backend database for my content, which is inaccessable Squarespace.

      <br>
      <br>
      So, started using Jekyll it seemed like a great alternative. My entire blog is tracked in git as static files. Backups are trivial now, I simply fork the repository and hack away.  Finally, I can compose my posts as Markdown, which I am familar with from Rails &amp; GitHub.
      <br>
      <br>
      The fact that GitHub provides free hosting Jekyll is just amazing. It saves me the hassle of spinning up a EC2 or DigitalOcean server and maintaining it regularly.
